David Baker's Talk:
   The most interesting challenge to me is the expansion of the genetic code. There is so much interesting 
    chemistry that we aren't able to reliably engineer into proteins yet. I would love to work on expanding     that capability.

   I would like to learn more about what kinds of data are the AI models training on as well as what       features
the models are picking up on to predict the protein sequence.
